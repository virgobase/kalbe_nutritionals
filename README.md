#**PROJECT-BASED VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP - DATA SCIENCE KALBE NUTRITIONALS**

***

Hello, welcome to my project!
In this project, I am as a Data Scientist in Kalbe Nutritionals have some problems and challenges to be solved. 
There are 2 challenges and 2 problems than need to be examined! Dataset provided by Kalbe Nutritionals x Rakamin Academy.

#**CHALLENGE**
##**Challenge 1:**
In this session I've been challenged to do some queries in SQL. Basically it was a basic query with a purpose to have some exploratory data analysis. For the documentation, you can check it on [Query Documentation]()

##**Challenge 2:**
After that, I've been challenged to make a dashboard with the same dataset. The dashboard should inform Monthly quantity sold, daily totalmount, total sales (qty) per product, total sales (totalamount) per store.

#**MACHINE LEARNING**
##**Regression Time Series:**
Given a timeseries dataset that contains a report of product quantity sold. In this machine learning project, I need to make a predictive model to predict or forecast the quantity of the product being sold the next month and daily.
Using ARIMA as the model, MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the metrics evaluation. In this project I successfully forecast the product quantity being sold on January 2023, quantity as a whole and also quantity per product. 
For documentation you can check it here, [forecast quantity]()

##**Clustering with K-Means:**
The dataset given is informing about customer transaction towards some sort of snack/food product. As a data scientist, I've asked to do customer segmentattion and then make some business recomendation based on the customer cluster characteristics.
This project handled using K-Means method, then found there are 3 clusters based on the dataset. The whole documentation can be seen here, [Clustering K-Means]()
